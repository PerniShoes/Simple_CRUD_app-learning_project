### Basic CRUD app
Simple app using DevExpress, XPO, C#  
Connected with SSMS localhost server (or defaultDatabase)
#
In case dependencies don't work, I've added a folder with those needed for x64 platform. 
Should Visual Studio have issues with NuGet, it should be enough to copy the x64 folder inside bin.  

In case it doesn't work regardless, there's a showcase video ;D:
